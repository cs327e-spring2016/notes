# CS 327E Notes for 2016-04-04

M3 was due at the beginning of class today. Note that **each person**
should have sent us an email (see the project spec).

Depending on how your team has chosen to divide tasks, you should be working on M4,
but possibly M5 as well.

### Emails

We ask for a very specific subject line on the emails. This helps us ensure that your grade is computed correctly and minimizes errors on our end. Please help us with this---if you get a kickback email saying that your subject line is wrong, that is why.

### Milestone 4 stuff

You may use whatever software or service that you'd like.

We recommend Lucid Chart (http://www.lucidchart.com). You can sign up for a Pro trial account for 7 days, after which you can request an educational discount to get a Pro account for free (https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/usecase/education-request).
