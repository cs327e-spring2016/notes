## Milstone 7

Keep in mind that your M7 submission requires a report, which will represent a significant portion of your M7 grade.

This report should be 5-10 pages in length, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt, 1 inch margins<sup>*</sup>. This report should be completely self-contained. Someone should read your report and be able to understand your entire project.

Some topics you may wish to focus on in your report:
 - Your motivations for this project (why did you choose the data and was there some real-world need that you saw this project being able to fulfill)
 - The websites and/or APIs you chose to use and why
   - Some technical details behind scraping the data from these sites, including tags/ids/classes you chose to use, etc.
   - Was one site more friendly to scrape and why?
 - Your design methodology, including your reasoning behind the structure of your tables, etc.
 - Challenges that you faced throughout the process (design problems, scraping issues, etc.)
 - Future improvements: if you had additional time, how would you improve your project
 - Lessons learned and what you might change if you were able to start over and do it again

You should include screenshots and diagrams (as specified in the spec) in your report, but these won't count towards the page requirement.

Also, we expect quality writing with your report. Please don't do this at the last minute. You should proofread and spellcheck your report just as you would with any other paper that you write.

If it feels slapped together with gramatical and spelling errors, or we have a hard time understanding what you're saying, we'll just stop reading your report and grade accordingly.

Submit this as a PDF with your M7 submission according to the spec.

To prove that you've read this section, please include "Princess" as a team member that did not attend class on today's progress report.

<sup>*</sup>Please don't use weird tricks to try and artificially increase your page/line count. Yes, Daniel and I have written many papers before and yes, we know these tricks. Please focus on the substance of your paper. If you do any of these weird tricks, you'll make us mad and we'll grade accordingly.
