 - Keep in mind that your M7 submission requires a report, which will represent a significant portion of your M7 grade.
 - This report should be 5-10 pages in length, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt, 1 inch margins.
 - This report should be completely self-contained. Someone should read your report and be able to understand your entire project.
 - Some topics you may wish to focus on in your report:
   - Your motivations for this project (why did you choose the data and was there some real-world need that you saw this project being able to fulfill)
   - The websites and/or APIs you chose to use and why
     - Some technical details behind scraping the data from these sites, including tags/ids/classes you chose to use, etc.
     - Was one site more friendly to scrape and why?
   - Your design methodology, including your reasoning behind the structure of your tables, etc.
   - Challenges that you faced throughout the process (design problems, scraping issues, etc.)
   - Future improvements: if you had additional time, how would you improve your project
   - Lessons learned and what you might change if you were able to start over and do it again
 - You should include screenshots and diagrams (as specified in the spec) in your report, but these won't count towards the page requirement
 - Submit this as a PDF with your M7 submission according to the spec
